the project involves a serie of slime creatures that are able to evolve and interact with eachother in a procedurally generated map 
using a list of behaviours. While the creatures does start as smal spheres they can grow up and change shape depending on user interaction:
the player is able to drop food into the map by using the mouse, this will create a food pellet that the creatures will seek and eat.
Once a creature eats a food pellet they lock in their mutation depending on which food they ate, the possible mutations are:

+ bipedal
+ quadrupedal
+ serpentine (snake-like)

This will affect their model and their behaviour towards eachother, some seing the other as friends or enemies. While the player have a say in what the
creatures become, they have no control over them nor they can change their behaviours once they grow up and mutate, what they do 
controll however is the amount of food to give a specific creature:When a creature eats enough food they create a second creature that
starts without mutations, this is used to simulate the creation of life and to try and keep the population balanced.

while the simulation of life is a complex study, enormous progress is being made by simulating aspects of it, this project focusses
on the social aspect of evolution and how it affects the relationships of the creatures that are being simulated: While they start as the same
they quickly separate in different categories and tend to group up with others of their kind.
